### Discovering a Wireless Network

The ideal first step is to be able to go in prepared, and with zero knowledge of their network, connect to it.  This comes with quite a few gotchas to having it work right, and won't always work, but certainly can underline the importance of password security if it does.

*First steps:*

  * Scan for networks
  * determine/guess the office network - some are obfuscated
  * confirm the office network before proceeding
  * airodump logging (handshakes, beacons, macs)
