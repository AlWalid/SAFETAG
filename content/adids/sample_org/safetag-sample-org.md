### People ###
Executive Director: Jamie ___ . Jamie is very excited about improving the organization's digital security.  Jamie met some trainers at a conference and believes it is important for the organization.  Jamie reached out to the auditor and has been the primary point of contact and the "managerial interview" subject.  Unfortunately, the audit overlaps with an important presentation, and Jamie will not available or even particularly responsive to email. More of a visionary than a leader, Jamie is often absent or disconnected from the details and challenges of the office. Jamis is fluent in a variety of languages.

Office Manager (and tech lead, printer repair, etc.) Taylor ____ Taylor is stretched between managing the finances for the entire organization, much of the grant-writing nitty-gritty and reporting work, and on top of that is the most technical person in the office;  often found supporting staff (mostly the ED) in printing/adware/website issues. Taylor speaks limited English in addition to the local language.

Project Director Cameron ___ : Cameron has the most seniority at the office, and both is the primary "director" or leader of the office as well as the lead on most of their program work. Cameron's time is heavily impacted by funding and reporting cycles, and often is the one to respond to emergencies.  While amazingly dedicated to the mission and work - especially the core human rights programs.  Cameron has dealt with some difficult crises both in life and working at LMR. Cameron is somewhat resistant to change, especially change that complicates "getting things done."

Communications Director / Outreach Program Manager : Dylan ___ : Dylan recently joined the organization to manage the website and other outreach/PR activities as the communications director, but helped win a large grant to work on digital media and now also directs this new program.  Dylan is ... not resistant enough to change, and signs up for every new app or social media site, and always has the latest, shiniest tech, but is not actually very deeply skilled technically speaking, but more of a "digital native" who is comfortable using, but not fiddling with, tech.

Program Manager: Shane ___: Shane does a lot of the heavy lifting on many of the LMR programs, including working with partners, doing field research, and contributes content to both reports and proposals.  Shane has a more "field" based view of the work.

Program Assistant: Casey __ : Casey handles a lot of the secretarial work of scheduling, supporting the directors, compiling reports and generally keeping things running.  Casey is comfortable with tech, but not a fast adopter -- preferring training and support from the office manager or Carter rather than fixing things that break.

Office Support - Carter __ is the first to arrive every day to unlock the office, make tea, and fetch lunch.  Comfortable enough in working on printers, and enjoys using cheap but interesting technology.
