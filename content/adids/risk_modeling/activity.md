### Activity  [stub]

Auditors are provided basic information about an organization and a basic assessment plan for that organization for an audit.  After a short time looking it over they will each be given a persona to become as "employees" for that organization. The trainer will then run a needs assessment activity (both asset, process, and risk analysis) with the "staff."
