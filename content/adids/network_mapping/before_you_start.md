### Before You Start

This lesson is best thought of as two separate lessons, combined for logical flow - first is the mapping segment where participants discover the layout of the network and what else is on it, and the second is a deeper dive into specific servers to scan for vulnerabilities.

#### Setting up Exploitation VM

Before you start the mapping exercises you will need to set up a laptop with multiple vulnerable virtual machines.

  * Set up exploitable virtual machines and connect them to the router.
  * Have one or two of the virtual machines not respond to ping's or other ICMP traffic. [TODO]
