This section is one of the few sections where the SAFETAG audit does go through attack scenarios, from attempting to "break in" to the wireless network to testing exposed ethernet jacks for connectivity. 

The reasons for this are threefold.  First, access to an organization's internal network tends to reveal sensitive data and "shadow" infrastructures (such as dropbox usage) that lead to many recommendations to improve access control and discussions of the value of defense in depth.  Second, the specific act of breaking the wifi password allows for a discussion on password security without attacking any specific user's password. Finally, with wireless networks treated as equivalent to wired networks in many offices, reminding the organization that wireless networks extend beyond the physical walls of the office is useful in discussing password rotation and guest network policies.

By walking organizations through the vulnerabilities of wireless networks, you have the opportunity to discuss password strength, and the power that having "offline" access to a password means in terms of brute forcing it, as well as the importance of defense in depth even within their trusted work network - reducing the services computers and servers are sharing, setting up local firewalls on computers, and requiring authentication to access files.

Even a few minutes of network "sniffing" by an adversary can enable them to work offline to reveal the network password.  Knowing this password would let someone then access the entire internal network, files shared internally, and even change network settings to enable remote access.  While in an ideal setup, this would give no further access to sensitive documents, it is not uncommon to find shared file folders, or to gain access to the firewall or network routers (often set to the default password, because they're only accessible from inside the network...).
