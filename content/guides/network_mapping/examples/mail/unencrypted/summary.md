A common issue with e-mail services is the lack of proper encryption. Staff should only be allowed to connect to the organization’s mail server using SSL or TLS encryption. 

When a staff member sends or receives email an attacker with access to the same local network can easily and invisibly read, record, or modify all messages in-transit to and from the organization’s mail server.
