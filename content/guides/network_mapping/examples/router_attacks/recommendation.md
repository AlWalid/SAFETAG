#### Recommendation: Change Default Router Passwords

While nominally "inside the firewall" and protected from remote attacks, leaving routers with default passwords, particularly wireless routers whose networks are often shared with visitors, is a potentially very high risk for an organization.  Anyone who has gained access to the network via legitimate or other means could subtly alter the router's configuration to provide remote access, or route traffic to an attacker-designated server.  Such changes can easily go undetected for long periods of time.
