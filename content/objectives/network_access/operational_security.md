  * Confirm that all devices you are accessing/scanning belong to the organization.
  * Clarify timing and seek permission with staff - some activities can tax the network or cause disruptions.
  * Once you have access to the network, you need to first document how you managed that and share it with the hosts.  This is a great moment to discuss passwords in many cases.  If you didn't manage to break through the password, it's not worth the precious audit time to brute force it - simply ask for the password and move on.  If it's a WPA network, you can work on cracking the password after hours, if only to demonstrate the amount of time their current password would "protect" them for against a dedicated attacker.
