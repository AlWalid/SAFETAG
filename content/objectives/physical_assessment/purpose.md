### Purpose

While the SAFETAG framework is focused on the security of data, the physicality of devices, backup drives, servers, and even hard-wired networks cannot be overlooked.

For many commercial enterprises, threats that depend on physical access to devices are considered the least probable (albeit the most potentially severe) digital security risks. So much so, that many security specialists concede, with a shrug, that there is no proper defense against an attacker with physical access to sensitive hardware.  While there is some truth to this, it is not particularly useful advice for small scale civil society organizations or independent media houses. The risks that advocacy and media organizations face are far more varied, and the cost of lost information can be crippling to their ability to operate.  Easily accessible open  network ports, particularly in more publicly accessible areas of the office provide entry points into trusted networks, and an insecure external backup drive could provide an adversary more valuable information than any amount of network or account based attacks would.

Ensuring that devices with data are physically secured and access to network ports, devices, and servers is limited provides a baseline level of protection from theft. Drive encryption, covered under Device Assessment, provides additional security.

Physical access threats covered in this section include, among others:

  * removal of computers, smartphones, servers, or backup hardrives containing sensitive information;
  * access to computers, smartphones, servers, or backup hardrives of the organization;
  * hardwired access to the network traffic
