Identify organizational areas of strength and weakness (expertise, finance,
willingness to learn, staff time, etc.) when engaging in technological
adoption/change.
Identify organizational barriers to adoption.


Mapping of adversaries, threats, likelihood, and damage level to understand priorities was super helpful. Including a final output as an example would have been very useful to understand how to package the results.


##### Barriers

<what are Barriers>

<why are barriers different than capacity? (This is more refined work on identifying the support that they need when we construct resources for recommendations.)>
