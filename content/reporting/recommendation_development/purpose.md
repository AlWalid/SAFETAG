The host needs to be able to take action after an audit. The recommendations that an auditor provides to address vulnerabilities must cover a range that allows an organization to address them in both the short-term and more comprehensively in the long-term. Based on conversations with the host it is also important to identify any vulnerabilities or adversaries that were identified that the auditor cannot identify any reasonable recommendation to protect against. Knowing an organization's strengths and weaknesses will allow the auditor to provide more tailored recommendations that an organization will be more likely to attempt and achieve. 

In doing this the SAFETAG auditor has an opportunity to act as a trusted conduit between civil society organizations in need and organizations providing digital security training, technological support, legal assistance, and incident response. As SAFETAG auditors develop deep knowledge of regional and global resources available the organizations they audit will have a greater chance of identifying resources that they can use. As auditors share resources they have identified back to the SAFETAG network, each auditor's possible impact can be increased.
