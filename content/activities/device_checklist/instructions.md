#### Walkthrough

The auditor inspects a subset of key and/or representative user devices (work & personal).  The auditor should focus on the work devices to limit scope creep, but if the office has many personal devices accessing organizational accounts/data, the auditor should share what "red flags" they are looking for and work in tandem with device owners and/or IT staff. For a small office, it may be possible to check every machine. For larger offices, the auditor should use a subset to get a feel for the overall security stance of user devices.

As you work through the approach below and the included OS-specific checklists, also interview the staff member about the other devices they use, and how they connect to work services - email/webmail, intra/extranet tools, Constituent Relationship Management (CRM) tools like CiviCRM or Salesforce, financial tracking tools, and website management tools.

 * Identify what privilege level services are running under -- Are users using accounts with admin privelges, or are they using another user and have to type in a password to get admin rights? [^privilege-separation-across-os]
 * Check for existence and status of anti-virus (and anti-malware tools) on the device. [^anti-virus-updates]
 * Record the version and patch levels of software on the device. [^identifying-software-versions]
 * Identify what level of encryption is being used and is available for data storage on the device. [^device_encryption_by_os]
 * Using the list of software versions and patches identify attacks and, if possible, identified malware that devices in the office are vulnerable to.
